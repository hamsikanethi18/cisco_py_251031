   # Write a Python program that:

    #1. Accepts a sentence from the user.
    #2. Splits the sentence into words and stores them in a **list**.
    #3. Converts all words to **uppercase** and stores them in a **tuple**.
    #4. Saves both the list and tuple into a file named **`sentence_data.txt`**.
    #5. Reads back the data from the file and displays it on the screen.


sentence=input("enter the sentence:(separated by space)")
print(sentence)
sentence=sentence.split()
print(type(sentence))
print(sentence,type(sentence))
Uppercase=[]
for i in sentence:
    Uppercase.append(sentence.append())
